Required Libraries

    pandas
    numpy
    sklearn
    matplotlib
    seaborn
    statsmodels

Usage

    Data Preprocessing: Run the data.ipynb Jupyter notebook to preprocess the data. This notebook handles data cleaning, feature engineering, and prepares the dataset for analysis.

    Region Mapping: Execute the regionMapping.py script to map regions. This script categorizes countries into regions based on the data.

    Analysis: Run the analysis files (featureAnalysis.py, correlationHeatmap.py, etc.) to perform specific analyses. Each analysis file outputs separate pieces of analysis with corresponding names in the project report PDF.
